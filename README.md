multifontviewer
===============

Lite TTF font viewer for Windows.

I needed to find a font that I used in a logo. Having a lot of fonts installed made it a nightmare.

I looked for font viewers but didn't find any good free one except for Opcion(http://opcion.sourceforge.net/). Opcion is good, it did the trick for me, but why not a .NET version?

I did find a lot of shareware though - and not all of it was good.

So I build this one. It took close to 5 hours.

It needs more work but it's functional.
